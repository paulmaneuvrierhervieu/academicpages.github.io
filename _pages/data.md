### Historical Social Conflict Database (HiSCoD)
Together with [Cédric Chambru](https://cedricchambru.github.io/), I developed the [Historical Social Conflict Database (HiSCoD)](https://mrsh.unicaen.fr/hiscod/accueil.html). In its currrent form, it lists information on more than 20,000 epsiodes of social conflict between the 12th century and the late 19th century. The website was created using the XML-EAD format and built with the [Pôle Document Numérique de la Maison de la Recherche en Sciences Humaines (MRSH)](https://mrsh.unicaen.fr/pluridisciplinaire/pole-document-numerique/) at the University of Caen Normandy. 

Raw data are available in csv format in the [Github repository](https://github.com/hiscod/hiscod-project) of the project. 

For more details on the construction of the database, please see the [data paper](https://doi.org/10.1017/S000305542300076X).  

### Primary Schools in Early Modern Normandy 
I am currently working on a new database project by collecting data on primary schools at the parish level in the long run (1300-1800). The aim is to provide a better understanding of the development of elementary school networks and contribute to the long-standing debate on the role of education in economic development during the pre-industrial era.
