<br>I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at the [University of Milan at the Department of Political and Social Sciences](https://www.unimi.it/en/ugov/person/paul-maneuvrier) working on an ERC project [DESPO](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/853033/fr) on the political consequences of deindustrialization under the supervision of [Anne-Marie Jeannet](https://sites.google.com/site/amjeannet/). 

<br>After getting a Master’s Degree in Medieval and Modern History, I defended my PhD thesis in December 2020 at the University of Caen Normandie entitled: [_Normandy in the Atlantic Economy during the Eighteenth Century. Production, Trade and Crises_](https://www.theses.fr/253135346). My thesis contributes to the literature on the economic development in the lon rung. I also document the political, social and economic consequences of various shocks on a regional economy. Another part of my research focuses on the evolution of living standards from the Middle Ages to 19th century and the French industrialisation. In 2021, I received the AFHE-BNP Paribas prize awarded by the French Economic History Association (AFHE) for the best dissertation in economic history. 

<br> Since the beginning of my PhD, I am also working with archeologists on colonial history. Using quantitative data and archeological evidence, I started a project on the 'Auxiliary Industries' of the Atlantic Trade. I have also wrote an article on log books of Norman slave ships in which I provide a detailed examination of a slave trade expedition during the American Independence War. 

<br>I am also a data enthusiast and a map creator addict. In November 2020, I published with [Cédric Chambru](https://cedricchambru.github.io/) the Historical Social Conflict Database [HiSCoD](https://www.unicaen.fr/hiscod/). This database is designed to provide to academic researcher and general public a set of resources for analysing social conflict from the Middle Ages to the 19th century.
