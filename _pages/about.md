<br>I am an economic historian currently working at the [University of Milan at the Department of Political and Social Sciences](https://www.unimi.it/en/ugov/person/paul-maneuvrier). Since 2020, I am working on an ERC project [(DESPO)](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/853033/fr) with [Anne-Marie Jeannet](https://sites.google.com/site/amjeannet/) on the political consequences of deindustrialization at the local level. Overall, my research lies at the intersection of economic history, archaeology, and political science in the long run. 

In my publications I contribute to the literature on the economic development in the long run and the Industrial Revolution. I also document the political, social and economic consequences of various shcoks on a regional economy as well as the evolution of living standards from the Middle Ages to the 19th century. 

In 2021, I received the AFHE-BNP Paribas prize awarded by the French Economic History Association (AFHE) for the best dissertation in economic history. 

<br>I am also a data enthusiast and a map creator addict. In November 2020, I published with [CÃ©dric Chambru](https://cedricchambru.github.io/) the Historical Social Conflict Database [HiSCoD](https://www.unicaen.fr/hiscod/). This database is designed to provide to academic researcher and general public a set of resources for analysing social conflict from the Middle Ages to the 19th century. In its current form it documents more than 20,000 episodes of social conflict for France, England, Germany, Italy, Spain, and more)
