<br>I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at the [University of Milan at the Department of Political and Social Sciences](https://www.unimi.it/en/ugov/person/paul-maneuvrier) working on an ERC project [DESPO](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/853033/fr) on the political consequences of deindustrialization under the supervision of [Anne-Marie Jeannet](https://sites.google.com/site/amjeannet/). 

<br>After getting a Master’s Degree in Medieval and Modern History, I defended my PhD thesis in December 2020 at the University of Caen Normandie entitled: _Normandy in the Atlantic Economy during the Eighteenth Century. Production, Trade and Crises_. My thesis contributes to the literature on the long-term development and consequences of various shocks on a regional economy. I have built several datasets on food riots, trade, industries, wages and prices. I have also been investigating the effects of the Eden-Treaty on the process of industrialization. In addition, I am contributing to the literature on the origins of the French Revolution and the debate on its economic consequences.

<br>I am also a data enthusiast and a map creator addict. During the first years of my PhD, I developed, alongside the digital cluster of the University of Caen-Normandy, using xml format, a database on food riots during the Eighteenth century, which will be available soon. In November 2020, with [Cédric Chambru](https://cedricchambru.github.io/) we published [HiSCoD](https://www.unicaen.fr/hiscod/) (_Historical Social Conflicts Database_) with the support of the Digital Cluster of the University of Caen-Normandy. This database is designed to provide academic researcher and general public with a set of resources for analysing social conflict from the late Middle Ages to the 19th century and currentlu includes information on nearly 10,000 social conflict events. 

<br>In parallel to my dissertation and during my visiting at the University of Chicago, under the supervision of [Paul Cheney](https://history.uchicago.edu/directory/paul-cheney), I started a work on colonial history during the 18th century using archival documents and archeological data. I wrote an article on log books of Norman slave ships and with a cluster of archeologists and historians, I am working on a paper on the “auxiliary industries” of the Atlantic Trade. I am also very interested in the food provisions of the colonies.

<br>Besides this, I started a project two years ago with Cédric Chambru focusing on wages and living standards in Normandy from the end of the Middle Ages to the 18th century. Together, we have built a new database on wages and prices to contribute to the debate on the Great Divergence in Europe by documenting the French case. We have also collected a new dataset for a demographic study.

<br>In the spring 2020, I published in collaboration with [Claude Dupuy](https://gretha.cnrs.fr/claude-dupuy/) (Professor at the University of Bordeaux) a [Digital Atlas](https://mortsoublies.fr/) on the French soldiers of the Second World War.
