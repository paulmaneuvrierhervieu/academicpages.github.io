Abstract: _Social conflict are omnipresent in human societies and fulfil several essential functions to their development and transformation, including the creation of new norms and institutions. The Historical Social Conflict Database (HiSCoD) is an ongoing project designed to provide to scholars and society-at-large with a set of resources for analysing social conflict from the Middle Ages to the end of 19th century. Based on original archival research and existing repositories, the aim is to provide a global database on social conflict in past societies by collecting, aggregating, documenting and harmonising data. As of today, the database contains data more than 20,000 episodes of conflict, from the fiscal scuffle to urban revolts involving thousands of individuals. For every event, we provide information on the date, location, type, and, when possible, number of participants, women participation, and a summary of the course of action. Each event is individually documented by a hierarchical system of forms relying on the XML-EAD technology. This article describes the data collection process and presents some descriptive statistics._ [Working paper available here](https://doi.org/10.5167/uzh-217109).

Abstract: _In 1787, the implementation of the Eden Treaty, one of the most important trade agreement of the 18th century, established for the first time a competitive system between France and England by reducing customs duties on many manufactured goods. In Normandy, one of the most industrialized regions of France, imports of cotton textiles from England caused a sharp decline in regional production and an economic crisis. Unable to sustain the competition with England, Norman manufacturers had to reduce their production, dismiss workers, or declare bankruptcy. In the following months, unemployment and vagrancy quickly rose and many social conflicts occurred in different parts of the province. 
The objective of this paper is to explore the socio-economic consequences of this trade agreement on political behaviours during the French Revolution. Using data on industries and social conflicts at the parish level we first document that the Eden-Agreement had a large socio-economic impact on parishes specialised in the textile industry. We also found that localities hit by the trade shock were more likely to support the French Revolution and the Jacobin government. Overall, our paper suggests that the treaty signed between France and England to keep the peace after the American War of Independence played an important role in the adherence to the policy pursued by the government during the French Revolution._
